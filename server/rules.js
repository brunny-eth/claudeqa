A Guide to the Rules of Match Play
Golf is played in two major forms: Match Play and Stroke Play.

In individual Stroke Play a player plays his/her own ball, in the company of others against a ‘field’ of other players, in a stroke, Stableford or par competition, over a designated number of holes ― usually 18, 36 or 72.

In individual Match Play two players – who are opponents ― play against each other on a hole-by-hole basis over a designated number of holes ― usually 18 or 36.

A match can be played between individuals or pairs. A pair of players are partners.

Match Play is the original form of the game: some would claim that it remains the most basic and ‘purest’ form of the game. It is the format that provides for a direct contest between two players on what is a true ‘level playing field’. That is, in any match the opponents are faced with exactly the same conditions, each knows what the other is doing and the ‘par’ for a hole is of no relevance. Opponents simply face each hole as an isolated contest with wins and losses being balanced until a winner is determined. While in some sports the winner must reach a designated finishing line, or the game may be time bounded or continue until a phase of play is completed, a golf match is completed when there are insufficient holes remaining in the stipulated round for the trailing player to draw equal with, or overtake, the leading player. This has an important influence on the strategy of the game.

Some would also say that Match Play is the same as Stroke Play in that the sole focus should be on playing the course, uninfluenced by one’s opponent. However, others would, correctly in my view, claim this approach denies the very essence of Match Play, which is a contest directly between two players (or teams), and understates the place and significance of psychology, personality and strategy.

Having a clear understanding of the Rules of Golf as they apply to Match Play is essential to becoming a successful match player.

This booklet focusses on Match Play between individuals but also addresses some special provisions applying to matches between pairs of players. It must be read in conjunction with the Rules of Golf as, wherever a situation arises that is not addressed directly by this booklet, the rules which are common to both forms of the game apply. In addition any Local Rules and Competition Conditions applying to a given competition will have a bearing upon how the rules are to be applied.

Individual Play
APPLYING THE RULES
In match play, the player and opponent may agree how to decide a rules issue so long as they do not knowingly agree to act contrary to the requirements of the rules.

THE GAME (Rules 3 – 4)
Result of a Hole and a Match (Rule 3.2a)

Winning a Hole

In match play the game is played by holes.

In normal circumstances a hole is won by the player who holes the ball in the fewer strokes (including penalty strokes). However, a player also wins a hole if it is conceded by the opponent or if a hole is lost by the opponent through incurring a General Penalty (loss of hole).

If the opponent’s ball in motion needs to be holed to halve or tie the hole and the ball is deliberately deflected or stopped by any person at a time when there is no reasonable chance it will be holed, the player wins the hole.

Halving or Tying a Hole

A hole is ‘halved’ when the player and opponent complete the hole in the same number of strokes or when they agree to halve the hole, provided one of them has played a stroke from the tee.

Winning a Match

A match is won when one player leads by more holes than the number remaining to be played or the opponent concedes the match or the opponent is disqualified.

Extending a Tied Match

If a match is tied after the final hole it may either be concluded as a halved match or continued until it is concluded in accordance with the conditions of the competition.

When Result is Final

The result of a match becomes final in the way stated in the conditions of the competition. For example, when the result is recorded on an official scoreboard or when the result is reported to a designated person appointed by the committee.

Concession of Stroke, Hole or Match (3.2b.)

A player may concede the opponent’s next stroke at any time (if the opponent’s ball is in motion a concession applies to the next stroke). For example, if a player lies three or the ball is in motion after the third stroke and the opponent concedes the next stroke then the player’s score for the hole is four.

A player may concede a hole before the hole has commenced or at any time during the play of the hole.

A player may concede a match before the match has commenced or at any time prior to the match being completed.

A concession may be communicated either verbally or by action which must be clear and cannot be declined or withdrawn. If a player lifts the ball in breach of a rule in the reasonable belief that a concession has been made by the opponent, there is no penalty and the ball must be replaced.

Applying Handicaps in Handicap Match Play (3.2c)

The player and opponent should tell each other their handicaps before commencing the match.

If the player declares a wrong handicap either before or during the match and does not correct the mistake before the opponent’s next stroke then:

If the player has declared a higher handicap than entitled and this affects the number of strokes to be given or received, the player is disqualified. However, if there is no affect then there is no penalty.
If the player has declared a lower handicap than entitled there is no penalty and the declared handicap will apply.
Handicap strokes are given by hole, and the lower net score wins the hole. If a tied match is extended, handicap strokes are applied in accordance with the competition conditions.

If the players mistakenly apply handicap strokes on a hole, the agreed result of the hole stands, unless the players correct that mistake before either player makes a stroke to begin another hole or, for the final hole, before the result of the match is final.

Note: Strokes must be given at holes designated by the ‘match index’ specified by the competition conditions. This could be:

A scorecard which contains a match index; or
Application of the generic (international) match index; or
Application of the stroke index.
Responsibilities of Player and Opponent (3.2d)
At any time during play of a hole or after the hole is completed, the opponent may ask the player how many strokes (including penalty strokes) the player has taken on the hole. When asked for the number of strokes taken or when volunteering that information the player must advise the opponent of the correct number. A player who fails to respond to the opponent’s request or provides incorrect information loses the hole unless the situation is corrected before;

the opponent makes another stroke or takes a similar action (such as conceding the player’s next stroke or the hole) during the hole; or
either player makes a stroke to begin another hole or takes a similar action (such as conceding the next hole or the match) and the incorrect information could affect the opponent’s understanding of the result of the hole; or
the result of the match is declared following completion of the final hole.
Except when the opponent is clearly aware that the player has incurred a penalty, the player must advise the opponent as soon as is reasonably possible that a penalty has been incurred. The player will be accountable for any penalty even if the player is unaware that a rule has been breached and a penalty incurred. Failure to comply with this provision incurs a penalty of loss of hole.

It is the responsibility of both players to remain aware of the match score. If players mistakenly agree on an incorrect score, that score will stand unless they correct their error prior to either player making a stroke from another tee or, in the case of the final hole, before the result of the match is declared.

However, where either player makes a timely request for a ruling on any matter arising from the match, the final score of the match must be corrected in accordance with that ruling.

Players are entitled to protect their interests under the rules and may, while avoiding collusion in breaching the rules (for which both will be disqualified), either act on or ignore an opponent’s breach of the rules or reserve the right to seek an official ruling at the earliest opportunity.

Clubs (Rule 4.1b)

When a player becomes aware ― whether during play of a hole or prior to the next hole being commenced ― that s/he is carrying more than 14 clubs or has breached the procedures in regard to a damaged club, the penalty must be applied to the hole just completed.

Once the result of the hole, and the status of the match, have been established, the match score must be adjusted by deducting one hole from the player’s score for each hole during which the rules were breached, to a maximum of two holes per round. That is, if a player who is 1 up in the match becomes aware that s/he is carrying 15 clubs whilst playing the 5th hole, and that hole is halved, the player would then be 1 down commencing the 6th hole: 1 up minus a total of 2 penalty holes becomes 1 down.

Taking a Club Out of Play (Rule 4.1c) 

When a player becomes aware either before or during a match that s/he is carrying more than 14 clubs the player must take immediate action to clearly indicate that a particular club is being taken out of play. This should include advising the opponent and/or turning the club upside-down in the bag or giving it to another person. If the player subsequently makes a stroke with such a club s/he is disqualified.

Damaged Ball (Rules 4.2b & 4.2c)

If a player reasonably believes that the ball has been cut or cracked while playing a hole the player may mark and lift the ball to examine it but (except when the ball is on the putting green) the ball must not be cleaned.

If the original ball is cut or cracked it may be replaced with a substitute ball but if the original ball is not cut or cracked it must be returned to play.

If a player lifts the ball without a reasonable belief that it is damaged or cleans the ball when lifted s/he incurs a penalty of one stroke.

If a player plays an incorrectly substituted ball or plays from the wrong place s/he incurs a penalty of one stroke.

PLAYING A MATCH (Rules 5 – 6)
Practising on the Course Before or Between Rounds (Rule 5.2)

A player may practise on the course before a round or between rounds except when prohibited by the competition conditions. Practice includes playing a stroke, testing a surface or rolling a ball anywhere on the course.

A player who breaches this rule will lose the first hole and will be disqualified for a second breach.

Practice During a Match (Rules 5.5a, 5.5b & 5.6a)

A player must not make a practice stroke at any ball during play of a hole except when it is made as a matter of courtesy in, say, returning a ball to another player or to a practice area.

Between the play of two holes a player may practise putting or chipping on or near the putting green of the hole just completed or on any practice green or on the teeing area of the next hole, in playing out a hole which has been decided. But such practice strokes must not be made from a bunker and must not unreasonably delay play.

A player who breaches this rule loses the hole in play or if the breach occurred between holes then the player loses the next hole.

Playing in Groups (Rule 5.4)

During a round, the player and opponent must play each hole in the same group.

When Players May or Must Stop Play (Rule 5.7a)

Players in a match may agree to stop play for any reason, except if doing so delays the competition. If they agree to stop play and then one player wants to resume play, the agreement has ended and the other player must resume play.

When Play is Suspended by the Committee (Rule 5.7b)

The committee may suspend play for a variety of reasons, but when players do not agree on how to proceed when play is suspended, if either player stops play then the game is suspended until the committee resumes play.

Beginning a Hole (Rule 6.1b)

When commencing a hole a player must play a ball from anywhere inside the teeing area.

If a player plays a ball from outside the teeing area or from a wrong teeing area there is no penalty, but the opponent may cancel the stroke. Such cancellation must be made promptly and before either player makes another stroke, and it cannot be withdrawn.

If the opponent cancels the stroke, the player must play a ball from inside the teeing area and it is still his/her turn to play otherwise the stroke counts and the ball is in play and must be played as it lies.

Playing a Wrong Ball (Rule 6.3c)

If a player makes a stroke at a wrong ball s/he loses the hole.

However, if the player and opponent play each other’s ball during the play of a hole, the first to make a stroke at a wrong ball loses the hole but if it is not known which wrong ball was played first, there is no penalty and the hole must be played-out with the balls exchanged.

Order of Play (Rule 6.4a)

On the first hole the order of play is either set by the competition conditions or the committee or is decided by a random method, such as tossing a coin or choosing a ball number (odd or even).

The person to play first is said to have the ‘honour’.

When commencing subsequent holes the honour is held by the player who won the previous hole or when the previous hole was halved, by the player who held the honour on the previous tee.

Where the result of a hole is in dispute and awaiting a ruling the match must be continued and the player who held the honour on the disputed hole must play first at the next tee.

During play of a hole the player furthest from the flagstick must play first. However, if the balls are equidistant from the flagstick the players may agree who will play first or determine the order of play by tossing a coin, and at any time the players may agree to play out of turn to save time.

Where there is no agreement, if a player plays out of turn there is no penalty, but the opponent may cancel the stroke. Such cancellation must be made promptly and before either player makes another stroke, and it cannot be withdrawn.

If the opponent cancels the stroke, the player must play a ball from the place where the cancelled stroke was made otherwise the stroke counts and the ball is in play and must be played as it lies.

Completing Play of a Hole (Rule 6.5)

A player has completed a hole when the player holes out or the player’s next stroke is conceded.

A hole is decided when:

the opponent concedes the hole; or
either player’s score is lower than the opponent could achieve; or
either player incurs a penalty of loss of hole.
PLAYING THE BALL (Rules 7 – 11)
Searching for Ball (Rule 7.1)

A player is responsible for finding the ball in play after each stroke and may take reasonable actions to find and identify it, such as, by moving sand or water, by moving or bending grass or by breaking bushes, tree branches and other growing or attached natural objects but only if any such action taken to find or identify the ball is reasonable.

If taking such reasonable actions as part of a fair search improves the conditions affecting the stroke there is no penalty but if the improvement results from an action that exceeded what could be deemed as reasonable for a fair search, the player loses the hole.

If sand affecting the lie of a player’s ball is moved while searching for or identifying the ball the player must re-create the original lie in the sand, but may leave a small part of the ball visible if the ball had been covered by sand. If the player plays the ball without having re-created the original lie, the player loses the hole.

Identifying the Ball (Rule 7.2)

A player’s ball at rest may be identified by:

the player or anyone seeing a ball come to rest in circumstances where it is known to be the player’s ball;
seeing the player’s identifying mark on the ball;
finding a ball identical to the player’s ball in an area where the player’s ball is expected to be provided that there is not an identical ball is in the same area and there is no other means of distinguishing the player’s ball.
A ball not identified in one of the above ways is a wrong ball.

Lifting Ball to Identify It (Rule 7.3)

Except when then ball is on the putting green, a ball which might be a player’s ball but cannot be identified as it lies may be marked and rotated or lifted for the purpose of identification.

If the lifted ball is the player’s ball or another player’s ball, it must be replaced.

The ball must not be cleaned more than needed to identify it.

If the player lifts the ball when not reasonably necessary to identify it, fails to mark the spot of the ball before lifting it or cleans it, the player incurs a penalty of one stroke.

Ball Accidentally Moved While Searching or Identifying (Rule 7.4)

If a player’s ball is accidentally moved by the player, opponent or anyone else while trying to find or identify it there is no penalty.

A ball moved accidentally must be replaced into its original position (which if not known must be estimated).

This means that if the ball was on, under or against any immovable obstruction, integral object, loose impediment, boundary object or growing or attached natural object, the ball must be replaced under or against such object, and if the ball was covered by sand, the original lie must be re-created and the ball must be replaced in that lie, but a small part of the ball may be left visible.

A player who breaches any of these procedures loses the hole.

Conditions Affecting the Stroke (Rule 8.1)

Conditions affecting a stroke include:

The lie of a ball at rest.
The area of the player’s intended stance.
The area of the player’s intended swing.
The player’s line of play.
The relief area where the player will drop or place a ball.
Actions Allowed (Rule 8.1b)

In preparing for or making a stroke, a player may take any of the following actions (in accordance with the relevant rules) and there is no penalty even if the action improves the conditions affecting the stroke:

Fairly search for the ball by taking reasonable actions to find and identify it.
Take reasonable actions to remove loose impediments and movable obstructions.
Take reasonable actions to mark the position of a ball and to lift and replace the ball.
Ground the club lightly directly in front of or behind the ball, except when the ball is in a bunker.
Firmly place the feet in taking a stance, including a reasonable amount of implanting of the feet in sand or loose soil.
Fairly take a stance by taking reasonable actions to get to the ball and take a stance; however the player is not entitled to a normal stance or swing, and must take the least intrusive course of action in consideration of the situation.
Make a stroke or the backswing for a stroke which is then completed except that when the ball is in a bunker touching the sand in the bunker in taking the backswing is not permitted.
In the teeing area place a tee in or on the ground, move, bend or break any growing or attached natural object, or alter the surface of the ground, remove or press down sand and soil,remove dew, frost or water.
Smooth sand in a bunker after a ball played from the bunker is at rest outside of the bunker.
On the putting green, remove sand and loose soil and repair damage.
Reasonably check a natural object to see if it is embedded or attached.
Actions Not Allowed (Rule 8.1a)

Except in the limited ways listed above, a player must not take any of the following actions if it improves the conditions affecting the stroke:

Move, bend or break any growing or attached natural object, immovable obstruction, integral object or boundary object or a tee-marker for the teeing area when playing a ball from that teeing area.
Move a loose impediment or movable obstruction into position so as to build a stance or to improve the line of play.
Alter the surface of the ground by, for example, replacing divots in a divot hole, removing or pressing down replaced or other cut turf that is in place or creating or eliminating holes, indentations or uneven surfaces.
Remove or press down sand or loose soil, except on the putting green.
Remove dew, frost or water.
A player who takes any of these actions loses the hole, unless the restoration of the condition is permitted and the condition is restored successfully.

Restoring Certain Conditions Improved Contrary to the Rules (Rule 8.1c)

If a player improves the conditions affecting the stroke by moving, bending or breaking an object or by moving an object to, for example, build a stance or improve the line of play, there is no penalty if the condition is restored prior to a stroke being made. However, if the player is unable to restore the condition to its original state the penalty cannot be avoided.

Restoring Conditions (Rule 8.1d)

In principle, a player is entitled to the conditions which pertain when the ball has come to rest after a stroke. If the conditions affecting a stroke are adversely affected by an event caused by any person, animal or artificial object, which occurs subsequent to the ball having come to rest, the player may, without penalty:

Restore the conditions as near as possible to their original state; or
Lift, clean and replace the ball; or
Where the original conditions cannot be easily restored, lift and replace the ball at the nearest point which is similar to the original conditions and is within one club-length of the ball’s original position.
However, the option to restore such conditions is not available if the changed conditions have been caused by the player, a natural object or a natural force. A player who breaches this provision loses the hole.
Player’s Deliberate Actions to Alter Other Physical Conditions (Rule 8.2)

Except where expressly permitted by the rules, a player must not deliberately take any action to alter any other physical condition to affect the ball at rest or the stroke which is made or where the ball might go or come to rest after the next stroke or a later stroke or where the ball at rest might go or come to rest if it moves before the stroke is made.

A player breaching this rule loses the hole.

Ball Lifted or Moved by Player (Rule 9.4)

Except when the player is permitted to do so in accordance with a rule, if the player lifts or deliberately touches the ball at rest or causes it to move, s/he incurs a one stroke penalty, and the ball must be replaced.

Ball Lifted or Moved by Opponent (Rule 9.5)

Except when the opponent touches or moves a player’s ball in conceding a stroke or hole, or at the player’s request, if the opponent lifts, moves or otherwise deliberately touches the player’s ball s/he incurs a one stroke penalty and the ball must be replaced.

If the opponent mistakenly marks and lifts the player’s ball on the green there is no penalty.

If the opponent accidentally moves the player’s ball while assisting in a search or identification or when the ball is on the putting green or in taking reasonable measures to mark, or lift the ball, remove an obstruction, restore a worsened condition or in taking relief, there is no penalty.

Ball-Marker Lifted or Moved (Rule 9.7)

If a player’s ball-marker is lifted or moved in any way (including by a natural force) before the ball is replaced, the player must either replace the ball into its original position (which if not known must be estimated) or replace the ball-marker or place a substitute marker.

If the player or the opponent lifts the player’s ball-marker or deliberately causes it to move (other than in the process of conceding a stroke or hole) when the ball is lifted and not yet replaced, the player or opponent incurs a one penalty stroke and the marker must be replaced (refer 13.1d, below).

Advice (Rule 10.2a)

During a match a player must not provide to, or seek advice from, any person other than his/her caddie or a person authorised by the competition conditions to provide advice.

Caddie (Rule 10.3)

A player may have a (one) caddie at any given time who may assist a player in several ways.

For example, the caddie may:

Carry or otherwise transport and handle the player’s clubs and equipment.
Search for the player’s ball.
Provide information and advice;
Smooth a bunker or take other actions to care for the course.
Remove loose sand and soil from, and repair damage on, the putting green;
Mark and lift the player’s ball on the putting green.
Clean the player’s ball, when permitted.
Remove a loose impediment or movable obstruction.
The caddie may, only with the player’s authorisation:

Take action to restore the conditions affecting the player’s next stroke (in accordance with Rule 8.1) when those conditions have been adversely affected by an event which occurred after the ball had come to rest.
Lift the player’s ball in any area of the course (other than the putting green, where this may be done without authorisation) when the rules require it to be replaced or when relief is to be taken.
The player is responsible for the actions of his/her caddie and actions of the caddie are treated as actions of the player for the purpose of applying the rules.

The caddie may not:

Concede a stroke, hole or match to the opponent or confirm the match score with the opponent on the player’s behalf.
Stand on or close to an extension of the line of play behind the player’s ball when the player commences taking his/her stance and until the stroke is made.
Stand on the line of play while a stroke is being made.
Replace a ball, unless the caddie was the person who lifted or moved it.
Drop or place a ball in a relief area.
Act without the player’s approval to take relief.
Ball in Motion Accidentally Strikes a Person or Outside Influence (Rule 11.1)

If a player’s ball in motion accidentally strikes the player or the opponent or either of their caddies or equipment or an outside influence, there is no penalty to either player, and the ball will normally be played as it lies. But, if the ball comes to rest on any person, animal or object relief must be taken in a one club-length relief area from the point on the course directly below where the ball came to rest.

When a ball played from the putting green hits the player, the flagstick or the person attending it (see 13.2 below), the club used to make the stroke, a ball marker, a ball at rest or an animal (other than one which meets the definition of a ‘loose impediment’) the ball must be played as it lies. But, if the ball hits any other person or other immovable obstruction the stroke must be cancelled and be re-played.

If the player does not replay the stroke, s/he loses the hole.

Ball Deliberately Deflected or Stopped (Rule 11.2)

There is no penalty to a player who deliberately deflects or stops the opponent’s ball when there is no reasonable chance of the ball being holed or when this is done either as a concession or when the ball needed to be holed to halve the hole. Otherwise, a player who deliberately deflects or stops any ball in motion loses the hole.

BUNKERS AND PUTTING GREENS (Rules 12 – 13)
Playing Ball in a Bunker (Rule 12.2) 

Loose Impediments and Movable Obstructions (Rule 12.2a)

Before playing a ball in a bunker, a player may remove loose impediments and movable obstructions. This includes any reasonable touching or movement of the sand which occurs in the process of removal.

Touching Sand in Bunker (Rule 12.2b) 

Before making a stroke at a ball in a bunker, a player must not touch the sand:

with a hand, club, rake or other object to test the condition of the sand in order to gain information for the next stroke, or
touch sand with a club directly in front of or behind the ball, except in fairly searching for a ball or in removing a loose impediment or movable obstruction, or
in making a practice swing, or
in making a backswing for a stroke (a backswing is not part of a stroke, which is the forward movement of the club with the intention of striking the ball).
However a player may:

reasonably plant his/her feet in the sand when taking a stance, or
smooth the sand at any time before making a stroke in order to care for the course (without improving the conditions affecting the stroke), or
place clubs or equipment in the bunker, or
touch the sand in measuring or in marking, in lifting or in replacing a ball, or
lean on a club to rest, maintain balance or prevent falling.
Once a ball is played and is at rest outside of the bunker there is no restriction on touching the sand in the bunker even if the player is subsequently required to take stroke-and-distance relief in the bunker or if the bunker is in the line of play for the next stroke to be made outside of the bunker.

A player who breaches any aspect of this rule loses the hole.

Actions on the Putting Green (Rule 13)

Lifting the Ball and Repairing the Green (Rules 13.1b & 13.1c)

A ball on the putting green may be marked, lifted and cleaned at any time by the player, the caddie or any person authorised (in a particular situation) by the player. Any person who lifts a ball without authority is deemed to have touched or moved the ball.

The ball lifted in accordance with the rules must be replaced by the player or the person who lifted it. If a player plays a ball replaced by any other person s/he incurs a one stroke penalty.

The player may at any time remove sand or soil from the green or take reasonable action, without unreasonably delaying play, to restore a damaged green to its original condition. However, a player whose actions exceed what is reasonable with a result that the playing conditions are improved loses the hole.

Ball or Ball-Marker on the Green Moves (13.1d)

There is no penalty if the player or opponent accidentally moves the player’s ball or ball-marker on the putting green.

The player must return the ball or ball- marker to its original position or place a ball-marker to mark that position. Except that if a ball moves after the backswing has been commenced and the stroke is completed, the ball must be played as it lies, without penalty.

If a natural force causes a player’s ball to move, the place from which the ball must be played is determined as follows:

If the ball has not been lifted, it must be played from the place at which it comes to rest.
If the ball has been lifted and replaced, it must be returned to its original position.
Testing of Green (13.1e)

Under penalty of loss of hole, during a round and while play is stopped a player must not rub the surface of or roll a ball on any green or otherwise take action to test the surface. Except that between two holes, a player may test the surface of the green of the hole completed or of a practice green.

Leaving Flagstick in Hole (Rule 13.2a)

A player may make a stroke from anywhere on the course with the flagstick situated in the hole but must decide prior to making the stroke whether to leave the flagstick in the hole, have it removed, have a removed flagstick replaced or have the flagstick attended.

If a player makes a stroke with the flagstick in the hole and the ball in motion then strikes the flagstick there is no penalty and the ball must be played as it lies.

After making a stroke with the flagstick in the hole neither the player nor his/her caddie may move or remove the flagstick to affect the motion of the ball. If this is done, the player loses the hole. However, there is no penalty if the player has the flagstick moved or removed for any other reason, such as when
s/he reasonably believes that the ball in motion will not be affected.

When the player has left the flagstick in the hole and has not authorised anyone to attend the flagstick, the opponent (or caddie) must not move or remove the flagstick if that may affect the motion of the player’s ball. If the opponent (or caddie) moves or removes the flagstick without authority before or during the stroke and the player makes the stroke without being aware of this or does so while the player’s ball is in motion after the stroke, the opponent loses the hole. However, there is no penalty if the opponent removes the flagstick when there is no reasonable possibility that the ball will strike the flagstick or if the opponent was unaware that the player was about to play or that the ball was in motion.

Removing or Attending the Flagstick (13.2b)

The player may make a stroke from anywhere on the course with the flagstick removed from the hole or may authorise someone to attend the flagstick and remove it while the ball is in motion but must decide prior to making the stroke whether to leave the flagstick in the hole, have it removed, have a removed flagstick replaced or have the flagstick attended.

The player is deemed to have authorised the flagstick to be attended if:

the player’s caddie holds the flagstick when the stroke is made, even if the player is not aware the caddie is doing so, or
the player asks any other person to attend the flagstick and that person does so, or
the player sees any other person holding the flagstick or standing next to the hole, and the player makes the stroke without asking that person to move away or to leave the flagstick in the hole.
If the player’s ball in motion accidentally strikes the flagstick or the person who is attending or who has removed the flagstick there is no penalty and the ball must be played as it lies.

Other than when there is no reasonable chance of the action having an influence on the outcome of the hole, if the player’s ball in motion after being played from the putting green is deliberately deflected or stopped by the person attending the flagstick, the ball must be replaced and replayed at the point from which the previous stroke had been made.

However:

If the ball was played from off of the green it must be placed and played from the estimated position at which it would have come to rest.
Irrespective of the positions from which the ball was played, if the person attending the flagstick is the player’s caddie, the player loses the hole.
Ball Overhanging Hole Lifted or Moved Prematurely (Rule 13.3)

If the opponent deliberately lifts or moves the player’s ball overhanging the hole before the player has had reasonable time to reach the hole plus ten seconds waiting time to see whether the ball will fall into the hole, the player’s ball is treated as holed with the previous stroke, and there is no penalty to the opponent.

LIFTING AND RETURNING A BALL TO PLAY (Rule 14)
Spot Must be Marked (Rule 14.1a)

Before lifting a ball under a rule which requires the ball to be replaced, the player must mark the spot by placing a ball-marker (coin, tee, plug-repairer, or the like) immediately behind or next to the ball or by placing a club on the ground immediately behind or next to the ball.

If the position is marked with a ball- marker, the ball-marker must be removed after the ball is replaced and prior to a stroke being made.

If the player lifts the ball without marking its position, marks its position in a wrong way or makes a stroke with a ball-marker left in place, the player incurs a one stroke penalty.

Who May Lift Ball (Rule 14.1b)

A player’s ball may be lifted only by the player, the caddie (when the ball is on the green) or a person authorised by the player.

If the caddie lifts the ball without authorisation anywhere other than on the green the player incurs a penalty of one stroke.

Who Must Replace the Ball (Rule 14.2b)

The ball must be replaced by the player or the person who lifted it.

If the player plays a ball replaced by any other person the player incurs a penalty of one stroke.

Cleaning Lifted Ball (Rule 14.1c)

A ball lifted from the putting green may always be cleaned.

A ball lifted from anywhere else may be cleaned except when it is lifted:

to see if it is damaged, in which case cleaning is not permitted; or
to identify it, in which case it may be cleaned only as needed for identification; or
because it might interfere with play, in which case cleaning is not permitted; or
to see if it lies in a postion from which relief is permitted, in which case cleaning is not permitted unless relief is taken.
A player who cleans a lifted ball when not permitted incurs a penalty of one stroke.

Dropping Ball in Relief Area (14.3)

To correctly drop a ball in a relief area:

The player may use the original ball or another ball.
The ball must be dropped in the relief area only by the player.
The ball must be dropped from knee height, without affecting how or where the ball will come to rest.
The ball must not touch the player’s body or equipment prior to striking the ground.
If a ball correctly dropped strikes any person, equipment or outside influence after striking the ground, there is no penalty and it must be played as it lies.
If a ball is incorrectly dropped, it must be re-dropped as many times as is necessary for a correct drop to be completed. A player who makes a stroke at a ball incorrectly dropped incurs a penalty of one stroke.

If a ball correctly dropped ball comes to rest outside of the relief area it must be re-dropped. If it again comes to rest outside of the relief area when correctly dropped, it must be placed on the spot where it first touched the ground on that drop. A player who makes a stroke at a ball which has come to rest outside of the relief area or at a ball which was placed when it should have been dropped loses the hole.

A ball dropped in a relief area must not be deflected or stopped unless it is clear that there is no reasonable chance of it coming to rest inside the relief area. Otherwise a player deliberately deflecting of stopping a ball loses the hole.

Correcting a Mistake in Applying a Rule (14.5)

In broad terms a player who mistakenly applies a rule by, for example, placing instead of dropping, dropping in the wrong place, or substituting a ball when not entitled to may correct the error without penalty before playing the ball.

There are many instances where the option to correct an error may occur and each may require a specific way to proceed. Hence, in correcting an error of procedure a player is advised to consult the rules or seek advice from a referee.

Playing from Wrong Place (Rule 14.7)

A player must make each stroke from where the ball has come to rest unless there is a rule which requires or allows the ball to be played from another place.

A player plays the ball from a ‘wrong place’ loses the hole.

FREE RELIEF (Rules 15 – 16)
Removal of Loose Impediment (Rule 15.1a)

A player may remove a loose impediment anywhere on the course, in any way except that:

When the ball is not on the putting green, before replacing a ball that was lifted or moved a player must not deliberately remove a loose impediment that, if moved when the ball was at rest, would have been likely to have caused the ball to move. A player who does so incurs a penalty of one stroke but the impediment does not need to be replaced.
When a ball is in motion a loose impediment must not be removed if there is a reasonable chance that it will affect the passage of the ball. A player who does so loses the hole.
Ball Moved When Removing Loose Impediment (15.1b)

Except when the ball is on the teeing area or the putting green, if a player’s removal of a loose impediment causes the ball to move the player incurs a penalty of one stroke and the ball must be replaced.

Relief from Movable Obstruction (Rule 15.2a & 15.2b)

A player may remove a movable obstruction anywhere on the course, in any way except that:

When a ball is to be played from the teeing area a tee marker must not be moved.
When a ball is in motion a movable obstruction must not be removed if there is a reasonable chance that it will affect the passage of the ball.
A player who breaches either of these rules loses the hole.

When the ball is in or on a movable obstruction, other than on the putting green, the player may lift the ball, remove the obstruction and drop a ball within a one club-length relief area. When the ball is on the putting green it must be placed at the estimated spot directly below where the ball was at rest.

If the ball is known or virtually certain to be lost in a movable obstruction the player may drop another ball within a one club-length relief area from the point where the ball last crossed the edge of the obstruction, without penalty. However, if it is not known or virtually certain that the ball has come to rest in the obstruction, the ball is lost and stroke-and-distance relief must be taken.

Ball Moved When Removing Movable Obstruction (Rule 15.2a)

If a player’s ball moves while s/he is removing a movable obstruction there is no penalty, and the ball must be replaced.

Ball Helping Play (Rule 15.3a)

If a player reasonably believes that his/her ball on the putting green might assist with the opponent’s play s/he may lift the ball.

Ball Interfering with Play (Rule 15.3b)

If the player reasonably believes that the opponent’s ball anywhere on the course might interfere with his/her play, the player may require the opponent to lift his/her ball.

A player may not lift his/her ball in the belief that it will interfere with the opponent’s play and if s/he does so will incur a penalty of one stroke.

Relief from Abnormal Course Conditions and Immovable Obstructions (Rule 16.1a-e)

Except when the ball is in a penalty area or it is clearly unreasonable to play the ball through interference by another condition, a player may take relief from interference by an animal hole, ground under repair, temporary water or an immovable obstruction to the lie of the ball, the stance or area of intended swing, or, when the ball is on the green, the intended line of play.

If the ball is in the general area, relief may be taken by dropping a ball in a one club- length relief area which affords complete relief from the interference.

If the ball is in a bunker, the ball must be dropped in the bunker. If complete relief is not available within the bunker, the player may take relief at the point which affords maximum relief. Note that if no relief is available in the bunker or if the player chooses to do so, a ball may be dropped back-on-line through the point where the ball lay, for a penalty of one stroke.

If the ball is on the putting green, the ball must be placed at the nearest point of complete relief either on or off the green. If complete relief is not available, the player may take relief at the point which affords maximum relief.

If the ball is known or virtually certain to be lost in an immovable obstruction or other abnormal course condition the player may drop another ball within a one club-length relief area from the point where the ball last crossed the edge of condition, without penalty. However, if it is not known or virtually certain that the ball has come to rest in the obstruction, the ball is lost and stroke-and-distance relief must be taken.

No Play Zone (Rule 16.1f)

Relief must be taken for the ball at rest in a no play zone.

Dangerous Animals (Rule 16.2b)

Including in a penalty area, a player may take relief from interference by a dangerous animal condition by dropping in a one club-length relief area from the nearest point where interference is avoided, in the area of the course where the ball lay.

Embedded Ball (Rule 16.3a)

If a player’s ball is embedded in the general area (other than in sand in an area not cut to fairway height) relief may be taken by dropping a ball in a one club-length relief area from the point directly behind the point where the ball was embedded.

If the ball is embedded on the putting green, it may be lifted, the green repaired and the ball placed upon that spot.

PENALTY RELIEF (Rules 17-19)
Ball Is in Penalty Area (17.1a)

A ball may be played from a penalty area (marked red or yellow) but if a player’s ball, which cannot be found, is known or virtually certain to have come to rest in such an area or the player wishes to take relief from a penalty area s/he may do so by either dropping a ball in a one club-length relief area at the point where the ball was last played or taking back-on-line relief (see below). In addition, when a ball comes to rest in a red penalty area, relief may be taken within a two club-length relief area from the point where the ball last crossed the boundary of the penalty area. 

Taking relief incurs a penalty of one stroke.

Stroke-and-Distance Relief (Rule 18.1)

At any time, a player may take stroke-and-distance relief by adding one penalty stroke and playing a ball from within a one club-length relief area at the point where the previous stroke was made.

Back-on-line Relief (R16.1c(2),17.1d(2),19.2b,19.3b)

When back-on-line relief is permitted, the player must, for a penalty of one stroke, drop a ball at any point on the line to the hole through the place where the ball lay or in the case of a penalty area, the point where the ball last crossed the boundary of the area.

A dropped ball which comes to rest more than one club-length in any direction from the point where it is dropped, must be re-dropped.

When a player plays a ball which was not dropped on the line the player loses the hole.

Ball Lost or Out of Bounds (Rule 18.2)

Ball Lost

When a ball is not found within three minutes of a player or his/her caddie beginning to search for it, the ball is lost. If a ball is lost the player must put another ball into play under stroke-and-distance relief.

Ball out of bounds

A ball is out of bounds only when all of it is outside the boundary edge of the course.

If a ball is out of bounds the player must put another ball into play under stroke- and-distance relief.

Unplayable Ball (Rule 19)

The player is the only person who can decide whether a ball is unplayable: anywhere on the course, at any time. Except when the ball is in a penalty area the player may:

take stroke-and distance relief, or
drop a ball within a two club-length relief area from the point, not nearer to the hole than where the ball lay, for a penalty of one stroke, or
take back-on-line relief.
If the ball is in a bunker, relief must be taken within the bunker. But, back-on-line relief may be taken outside of the bunker for a total penalty of two strokes.

RESOLVING RULES ISSUES (Rule 20)
Resolving a Rules Issue During a Match (Rule 20.1b)

During a round, the players in a match may agree how to decide a rules issue.

The agreed outcome will be conclusive even if it turns out to have been incorrect, provided that the players did not knowingly agree to ignore any rule or penalty. But if a referee is assigned to the match, the referee must rule on any issue that arises and the players must follow that ruling.

If no Referee is available within a reasonable time, either player may state the intention to seek a ruling from the referee or the committee at the first opportunity (which may be at the conclusion of the match, but before the match result is final) and the players must continue the match without delay.

If a player becomes aware of information upon which s/he wishes to seek a ruling before either player begins the final hole of the match then a statement of intention must be made before either player plays from the next teeing ground or, if the information becomes available during or after the completion of the final hole, a ruling request must be made before the result of the match is final.

Team Play
FOURSOMES MATCHES
Foursome (Rule 22)

In Foursome play, two players function as a team or side playing one ball.

In general terms these players are one entity. The rules for individual match play apply and a breach of the rules by one of the players is a breach by the team.

Playing out of order

If a player plays when his/her partner should have played, the team loses the hole.

Accidental failure to strike the ball

If a player misses the ball (an ‘airy’) in attempting a stroke, his/her partner must play the next shot.

Provisional ball

If the team wishes to play a provisional ball it must be played by the partner who did not play the original ball.

If the provisional ball is wrongly played the team loses the hole.

Ball lost, out of bounds or unplayable

If a team’s ball is lost (inside or outside of a penalty area, ground under repair or temporary water), out of bounds or unplayable, the next shot is played by the partner who did not play the original ball; that is, the normal order is maintained and is not affected by the application of any penalties.

Application of penalties

The general principle is that penalty strokes do not affect the order of play.

Handicap

Handicap is a half the difference between the aggregate handicaps of the sides, rounded up where necessary to the next whole number

That is, if A & B with indvidual handicaps of 20 and 15 are playing C & D whose handicaps are 8 and 14 then A & B will receive 7 strokes from C & D.

(20+15) – (8+14) = 35 – 22 = 13

13 divided by 2 is 6.5 which when rounded up becomes 7.

Strokes are taken on the match or stroke index as specified in the competition conditions.

FOUR BALL MATCHES
Four Ball (Rule 23)

This is actually two-ball better-ball in which two players play their individual balls and the better score for the team or side is compared to the better ball of the opposing team.

Order of play

Partners may play their balls in whatever order they consider best.

Absent partner

A team may be represented by one of the partners for all or part of a match.

An absent partner may join a match at any time between the play of holes, but not during the play of a hole.

Advice

Partners may confer and provide advice at any time.

Putting

A partner who, closer to the hole than his/ her opponent, decides to putt first may stand on the partner’s line in the process of playing the stroke.

A player may at any time waive the right to putt but in doing so forfeits the right to further play in the hole.

Application of penalties

Generally, if one of the partners incurs a penalty then that penalty is applied to that player only. For example if one of the partners plays a wrong ball and is thereby ‘disqualified’ from the hole, the partner incurs no penalty even if the ‘wrong’ ball belongs to him/her. However, if a player’s breach assists his/her partner or adversely affects the play of an opponent then both offending partners incur the applicable penalty.

If one partner breaches the rules regarding number and use of clubs then the side incurs the adjustment of match score penalty under Rule 4.1.

Handicap

The lowest marker reverts to scratch and gives strokes to all players, including his/her partner, in accordance with the handicap differences.

That is, if A & B with handicaps of 4 and 12 are playing C & D whose handicaps are 8 and 17, then A receives no strokes, B receives 8, C receives 4 and D receives 23.
